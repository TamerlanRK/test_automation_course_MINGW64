Lay beside me, tell me what they've done
Speak the words I wanna hear, to make my demons run
The door is locked now, but it's opened if you're true
If you can uderstand the me, then I can understand the you

Lay beside me, under wicked skies
Through black of day, dark of night, we share this paraluze
The door cracks open, but there's no sun shining through
Black heart scarring darker still, but there's no shining through
